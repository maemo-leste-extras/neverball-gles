 Octocat-Ball (see also doc/legal/license-octocat.md)
 ============
 .
 The OCTOCAT® logo design is an exclusive trademark registered in the United
 States by GitHub, Inc and is used in Neverball with permission. More details
 on Octocat usage can be found on the GitHub website at
 https://github.com/logos.
 .
 Special authorisation to use Octocat in Neverball was requested in November
 2013 and given by GitHub according to the following dialogue.
 .
 Request made by Josh "Cheeseness" Bush on behalf of the Neverball community:
 .
 Hi there! We've just moved our F/OSS project
 [Neverball](https://github.com/Neverball/neverball) to GitHub and would  like
 to add an Octocat themed bonus ball in the game to celebrate.
 I have made a work-in-progress ball, but would like to seek permission before
 including it in the game, as it seems to be outside the preferred usage.
 .

 .
 Many thanks <3

 Response from Haleigh on behalf of GitHub Staff:
 .
 Hi Cheese,
 .
 I bring you rad tidings from the Octocat-tamers! It's totally cool for you to
 include the Octocat bonus ball in the way you've outlined.
 .
 Thanks so much for checking in with us first, and happy new-GitHub-home to Neverball!
 .
 Cheers,
 .
 Haleigh

Comment:
 The routines are almost the same as libjpeg62's jdatasrc.c, only minor
 changes have been made to use a custom data source based on PhysicsFS.
 Neverball's file type (fs_type) and read routine (fs_read), are used
 instead of FILE and JFREAD.
