Neverball for Debian
====================

Available packages
------------------

Neverball provides two games: neverball itself and neverputt. In Debian, the
games are split in separate packages so that it is possible to install them
independently.

It should also be noted that the tool used to compile maps, `mapc', is
included in the neverball package. So, if you want to create maps for
neverputt, you'll also need to install neverball.
